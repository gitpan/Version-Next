NAME
    Version::Next - increment module version numbers simply and correctly

VERSION
    version 0.003

SYNOPSIS
       use Version::Next qw/next_version/;
 
       my $new_version = next_version( $old_version );

DESCRIPTION
    This module provides a simple, correct way to increment a Perl module
    version number. It does not attempt to guess what the original version
    number author intended, it simply increments in the smallest possible
    fashion. Decimals are incremented like an odometer. Dotted decimals are
    incremented piecewise and presented in a standardized way.

    If more complex version manipulation is necessary, you may wish to
    consider Perl::Version.

USAGE
    This module uses Sub::Exporter for optional exporting. Nothing is
    exported by default.

  "next_version"
       my $new_version = next_version( $old_version );

    Given a string, this function make the smallest logical increment and
    returns it. The input string is very minimally checked that it resembles
    a version number. Given "undef", the function returns 0.

    Decimal versions are incremented like an odometer, preserving the
    original number of decimal places. If an underscore is present
    (indicating an "alpha" version), its relative position is preserved.
    Examples:

       0.001    ->   0.002
       0.999    ->   1.000
       0.1229   ->   0.1230
       0.12_34  ->   0.12_35
       0.12_99  ->   0.13_00

    Dotted-decimal versions have the least significant element incremented
    by one. If the result exceeds 999, the element resets to 0 and the next
    most significant element is incremented, and so on. Any leading zero
    padding is removed. Examples:

      v1.2.3     ->  v1.2.4
      v1.2.999   ->  v1.3.0
      v1.999.999 ->  v2.0.0
      v1.2.3_4   ->  v1.2.3_5
      v1.2.3_999 ->  v1.2.4_0
